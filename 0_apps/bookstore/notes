- open package.json and populate the dependencies tag.
- to install the dependencies npm install
- install bower to manage dependency of the client side components
  (Bower is similar to npm on server side)
  npm install -g bower

 - using bower install the following client side libraries in the project
   install them in the /public folder
    bower install --save bootstrap angular angular-route jquery
